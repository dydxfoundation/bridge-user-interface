    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) for various purposes,
      including potentially to analyze traffic on our Website, to grow our business, to improve and
      develop our services, to monitor and analyze use of our services, to aid our technical
      administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our services, and to
      verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their request. Google may
      collect your IP address, and other information (although typically not your name), and
      utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of our Website, and to prepare
      reports for us based on your activities online, among other uses. As part of Google Analytics,
      Google tracks many variables, including what website you visited prior to coming to our
      Website, how long you stay on a particular page, and your geographic location. Please be aware
      that Google uses the data it collects from our Website for its own purposes, and we do not
      control or direct such usage. Please visit Google’s privacy policy to understand how Google
      uses the information it collects: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be able to opt out of the use of Google Analytics by visiting
      https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. You may be able to opt out of having your website
      activity available to Google Analytics by visiting
      https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en and installing the Google Analytics

    </p>

    <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
    <p>
      Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a concept promoted by certain regulatory authorities and industry
      groups for development and implementation of a mechanism that would allow internet users to
      control the tracking of their online activities across websites. Currently, various browsers
      (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that allows a user to
      set a preference in the browser to not have his/her activities on the internet tracked. You
      can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences. When a user’s
      browser is set to DNT, some cookies and other tracking technologies may become inactive,
      depending on how the website visited responds to DNT browser settings. If that occurs, the
      website visited will not recognize you upon return to that website, save your passwords or
      user names, and some other features of a website may become unavailable or not function
      properly.
